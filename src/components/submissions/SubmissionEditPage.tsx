Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of the file, add the missing closing bracket for the SubmissionEditPage component
};

export default SubmissionEditPage;
```

The file was missing one closing curly brace `}` at the very end to close the `SubmissionEditPage` component definition. I've added it back in the correct location.

The rest of the file's brackets were properly matched and closed. The file is now syntactically complete and should compile correctly.
